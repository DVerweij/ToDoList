The following app is an app that allows a user to setup a list of items that the user is willing or has to do.
A SQLite database saves these tasks so data can be saved for further use of the app.
Long clicking allows for deletion of an entry.
Clicking allows the user to check off certain done tasks, which will be colored yellow.
